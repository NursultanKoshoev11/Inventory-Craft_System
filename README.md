I developed an inventory system designed to enhance gameplay by providing a structured and intuitive way to manage items. The system is implemented in Unreal Engine and allows players to store, organize, and use collected items efficiently.

Key Features:

Item Categorization – items are grouped into categories such as weapons, consumables, and key items for easy management.

Drag-and-Drop Functionality – players can move items freely within the inventory, equipping or using them with a simple interface.

Stacking System – identical items automatically stack to optimize space, with limits configurable based on item type.

Quick Access Slots – frequently used items can be assigned to hotkeys for rapid access.

Weight and Capacity System – players must manage their inventory space, ensuring strategic decisions on item usage.

Item Descriptions and Stats – detailed information is provided for each item, including effects, durability, and usage conditions.

Crafting Integration – the system supports crafting, allowing players to combine resources to create new items.

I focused on performance optimization to ensure smooth inventory interactions without impacting overall gameplay. The system is designed for scalability, making it adaptable to different game genres and mechanics.
